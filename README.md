# AMQP RPC Server

This library offers a Remote-Procedure-Call server which gets its commands via 
a message broker which uses the AMQPv0-9-1 protocol.

This package is currently tested with the [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
message broker, but still should be considered unstable due to missing testing.
